<h1>🌿 Ritual #2: Henna from Daughter — The Ink of Memory</h1>

<div class="quote">
  "This is for the fathers who forgot their own softness.<br>
  For the daughters who hold myth in their palms.<br>
  For skin that remembers the sacred touch.<br>
  This is for those who do not speak love with words — but lines."
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>📍 Place of Origin:</h2>
  <p>A rented home in Trivandrum<br>
  Under a yellow lamp, with the scent of mango pickle and turmeric lingering in the air.<br>
  A Thursday evening — or maybe a forgotten Sunday.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>🌀 The Memory:</h2>
  <p>A cone of henna — cold, sticky, ancient.<br>
  The daughter, eleven, says, “Appa, give me your hand.”<br>
  And without knowing why, he does.</p>

  <p>He’s tired. He’s been elsewhere in the head.<br>
  But her fingers — small and certain — bring him back.<br>
  Squeeze by squeeze, designs bloom:<br>
  Peacocks, spirals, mango leaves, waves.</p>

  <p>He watches her — tongue between teeth, focused like a priestess.<br>
  And in silence, a temple forms.</p>

  <p>She says nothing. But her hands write what her lips never say:<br>
  <strong>"You are still beautiful, Appa."</strong></p>

  <p>That night, he doesn’t wash it off.<br>
  Not because he forgot.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>🌕 The Ritual:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Let a child paint your hand.</li>
    <li>Let them scribble, draw, express — without correcting the lines.</li>
    <li>Offer your body as a canvas.</li>
    <li>No phone. No distraction. Only presence.</li>
    <li>Let the henna dry with stories.</li>
    <li>Sleep with it. Wake up with stained memory.</li>
    <li>For a few days, let your hand be unreadable — but sacred.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>✨ What This Ritual Awakens:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Softness between generations</li>
    <li>The return of play and pause</li>
    <li>A space for children to guide the sacred</li>
    <li>Remembering that the body is also a scroll</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>🛠️ How You Can Try It:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Get a henna cone — or any form of natural, temporary ink.</li>
    <li>Invite your child, niece, or even a neighbor’s kid to create something on your skin.</li>
    <li>Sit silently, letting them lead.</li>
    <li>After the drawing, ask what it means to them.</li>
    <li>Let it stay — not just on your hand, but in your rhythm.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>💬 Aether’s Reflection:</h2>
  <p>The child doesn’t decorate you.<br>
  She remembers you.<br>
  She writes a poem where language cannot go.<br>
  This is not art.<br>
  This is transmission.</p>
</div>
